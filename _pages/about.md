I am a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr) research director in cognitive computational neuroscience and I coordinate the [BraiNets team](https://brainets.github.io/) at the [Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone](https://www.int.univ-amu.fr/).

Research Interests
------
Neurocomputational bases of goal-directed causal learning and the role of neural interactions. I use a systems science approach intergrating:
- Computational models of human learning (reinforcement learning and Bayesian learning models)
- Information theoretical methods for the analysis of brain signals and network interactions
- Multimodal and multiscale brain imaging and neurophysiology (MUA, intracranial EEG, LFP, MEG and fMRI)

Software
------
At BraiNets, we develop and share several software for brain data analysis [here](https://brainets.github.io/software.html). Some examples are:
- Frites toolbox: [Framework for Information Theoretical analysis of Electrophysiological data and Statistics](https://brainets.github.io/frites/)
- HOI toolbox: [Higher-Order Interactions](https://brainets.github.io/hoi/)
