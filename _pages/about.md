I am a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr) research director in cognitive computational neuroscience and I coordinate the [BraiNets team](https://brainets.github.io/) at the [Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone](https://www.int.univ-amu.fr/).

Research Interests
------
My research projects investigates the role of brain interactions in learning and adaptive behaviors. The main theoretical approaches and methodology characterizing my research projects are:
- Functional Connectivity analysis of brain networks
- Information theory and network science
- Multimodal brain imaging techniques (MEG, intracranial EEG, LFP and fMRI)
- Computational models of human learning (Bayesian inference and reinforcement learning)
Since 2020, I am also involved in the developement of the [EBRAINS](https://ebrains.eu/) research infrasctructure within the Human Brain Project.

Publications
------
My publications and citation record are on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=vsskO0AAAAAJ&hl=en)

Software
------
At BraiNets, we develop and share several software for brain data analysis [here](https://brainets.github.io/software.html)
