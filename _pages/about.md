I am a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr) research director in cognitive computational neuroscience and I coordinate the [BraiNets team](https://brainets.github.io/) at the [Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone](https://www.int.univ-amu.fr/).

Research Interests
------
My research projects try to elucidate the role of brain network interactions in learning and adaptive behaviors, through the combination of multimodal techniques (MEG, intracranial EEG, LFP and fMRI), computational models of learning and neuroinformatics tools for brain network analysis and modelling. 
Since 2020, I am also involved in the developement of the [EBRAINS](https://ebrains.eu/) research infrasctructure within the Human Brain Project.

Publications
------
My publications and citation record are on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=vsskO0AAAAAJ&hl=en)
