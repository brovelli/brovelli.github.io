### CausaL

Cognitive architectures of causal learning

Funding: Agence Nationale de la Recherche ANR - PRC, Jan 2019 - Jun 2023

Consortium: Andrea Brovelli (PI), Mateus Joffily (GATE, Lyon), Mehdi Khamassi (ISIR, Paris), Julien Bastin (GIN, Grenoble)

_The aim of this project is to study the neural and computational bases of human goal-directed causal learning by combining human neurophysiology (MEG and intracranial SEEG) and neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques with computational models of learning (Reinforcement Learning and Active Inference)._
